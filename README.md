##Working on a new app for a local Des Moines Concrete Contractor##

As I build more and more apps for different clients, I find that I am building more things that are simple shortcuts for small businesses.  That's the case with this project that I'm doing for a [Des Moines local concrete contractor](https://www.concretecontractordesmoines.com/) that wants a simple way for estimators to go to a jobsite and launch an app on thier iPad or iPhone and be able to bid jobs quickly.

I'm not very familiar with the concrete business but I am assuming that a big challenge will be in calculating the amount of concrete that is to be dropped at a job.  If we can calculate that, then an estimate for the labor on each project, we should be able to do really great estimates for any concrete contractor to use. I'm pretty sure the client in Des Moines will love it if it saves his concrete job quotes from being innaccurate.  

##Concepts of this project:##
